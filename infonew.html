                Design is simple, yet it's so ubiquitous that it's hard to pin down in one easy definition. Technically, graphic design is the communication of an idea using visual means. Graphic designers use various tools to achieve the goal, including elements like typography, colors, shapes, and illustrations.
                
                When you think of how many ways this art form touches your life on a daily basis, it's staggering. <br><br><br>
                
                The magazine you read during breakfast? To produce it, many graphic design jobs were created for the cover and layout design, the advertisements, and any special features or infographics. <br><br><br>
                
                The cereal box and coffee packages? The advertisements you see on your way to work, on billboards, and the sides of buses? What about the business cards and stationery your company uses? And when you look at your phone, each app was laid out and made more useable by a talented UI designer. 
                
                
                
                In short, every aspect of our visual world is touched by graphic designers in one way or another.  <br><br><br>
                
                Graphic design has become a dynamic and varied field that grows with each new technological medium invented. 
                It spans old-school media like printed magazines, posters, and fliers to modern methods like websites and apps. It's never going away, and demand for professionals grows every year. <br><br><br>

                <section class="py-5"><h1 class="sizehead mb-5">Types of Graphic Designing</h1>
                Since it varies considerably and consists of many different fields, it helps to break design into different categories. Designers may work on teams that put together all of these different things or work in a specialized field and only do one. As in all things business, the most successful enterprises are usually the niche ones where a company or individual can become known as an expert in one thing.'<br><br>

               <section class="py-5"><h2 class="sizehead mb-5">Printed Books and Magazines</h2>

                Let's start with the fields that most people commonly associate with design. No matter how simple and text-based they may appear, all books and magazines require a high level of design input. Design is about so much more than illustrations. A simple page layout can be presented in multiple ways, from how many columns it has to how photographs and illustrations are integrated. How are chapters differentiated, and how are topics and subheadings titled? What colors are used?<br><br><br>
               

                
                Finally, the cover design is always an essential element since it serves an advertising purpose as well. How does it grab attention? When a casual viewer walks by and sees it on the newsstand, do they immediately know what the publication is about? Do the title, typography, colors, and imagery all work to communicate a clear message? Making it happen is more challenging than it might seem.<br><br><br>

<section class="py-5"><h2 class="sizehead mb-5">Advertising and Marketing</h2>
                Ads touch our lives nearly constantly. Websites have them popping up everywhere, magazines seem to be full of them, and roadside billboards fill our landscape. Printed and visual advertising is a clear example of design at its purist it requires the creator to communicate a message in an effective way. Whether the purpose is to educate or to sell, ads require the viewer to receive a message.<br><br><br>
                
                
                Advertising agencies hire a lot of designers to put together their campaigns. The ad men (and women) put together the big picture ideas and make the sales, while the line designers make the actual product.<br><br><br>
                
                <section class="py-5"><h2 class="sizehead mb-5">Brand Identity</h2>
                A more subtle form of marketing is corporate brand identity. This is an area of design that requires a lot of big picture thinking and planning. A corporate identity is made up of a logo, typeface, and color selection used in all company materials. In today's connected world, the visual identity is a vital part of how customers connect with a brand.<br><br><br>
                
                We're all familiar with some famous trademarked brands, like the Coca-Cola typeface or the Apple logo. Think about how ingrained these are with the companies that created them. The red background and white letters on a Coke bottle are the same used on their websites, business cards, and all of their advertisements. The Apple logo is found on every device they've ever manufactured and is generally put on advertisements without any other text. Apple Stores usually only have a logo - do many people walk by and wonder what is sold inside? Probably not very many. That's the power of brand identity.<br><br><br>
                
                Most companies only dream of reaching that level of brand identity, but it all starts with a talented designer working to make something simple, like an apple with a bite taken out, recognizable and meaningful to consumers.<br><br><br>

                <section class="py-5"><h2 class="sizehead mb-5">Digital User Interface Design</h2>
                Websites, computer programs, and device apps all require design on different levels. Of course, there are programmers who are designing the functionality of the app and building it on a technical level. But most of the time, those people will hire experts in UI (user interface) design to make the front end work well and look great.<br><br><br>
                
                On a broader level, UX (user experience) designers work to make sure the app ecosystem works. It's not just about how things work. It's about human psychology and putting things where users expect them to be. How often have you visited a website and had to hunt around to find a simple piece of information? If the UX design was up to snuff, it shouldn't have taken that long. Know more<br><br><br>

                <section class="py-5"><h2 class="sizehead mb-5">Product Packaging Design</h2>
                Walk the aisles of your local supermarket or big-box retailer, and you will see thousands of products. How can companies make their products stand out? If they're a Coke or Apple and already have a brand identity, it's a lot easier. But what if a company is starting? The brand can only stand for so much when the customer is standing in the aisle looking for a specific thing to buy.<br><br><br>
                
                Product packaging comes in many varieties. While some of the limitations come from things like box sizes and shapes, there's still a lot of room for a graphic designer to work their magic.<br><br>

                <section class="py-5"><h2 class="sizehead mb-5">Dynamic Designs</h2>
                As technology evolves, so too must designers. Many ads that were previously static are now moving and dynamic. Animated web banner ads, gifs, and even moving billboards mean that a new specialty in the field has been created.<br><br> Designers who work in this area need to have experience in animation and moving picture technology, along with compositional techniques and ways to communicate with movement. <br><br>If you are confused about which animation software to choose, here is the list of most popular animation software in 2021.<br><br><br>
                
                <section class="py-5"><h2 class="sizehead mb-5">Illustrative and Artistic</h2>
                Many folks who get into design jobs do so because they love to draw or love art. They are inherently visual communicators. For them, the brand identity and typography part of the job is interesting and pays the bills, but many want to make more art.<br><br><br>
                
                Illustration is an integral part of design, too, from children's books to technical manuals. There are lots of artworks published in advertising and print every year. <br><br><br>
                
                Illustrative and Artistic
                Some graphic designers like to create their drawings from scratch, while others specialize in manipulating images and making composite photographs.<br><br><br>
                
                T-shirts, fabrics, websites, video games, infographics, and comic books are just a few examples of how these designs can be used. There's plenty that is done commercially, and plenty that is created for art's sake.<br><br><br>
                
                A winning illustrator portfolio is crucial if you are aspiring to make a successful career in the design industry. Here are some stunning Illustrator portfolios on Pixpa that are sure to inspire you to create your portfolio website.<br><br><br>

                <section class="py-5"><h2 class="sizehead mb-5">Environmental Design</h2>
                If you were to combine interior design and graphic elements, you would have what is called an environmental designer. They use signs, murals, and branding to improve the overall experience a visitor has to a building. <br><br>It's most noticeable where many people visit, and the organizers want to make an impression - think about stadiums, conference spaces, trade shows, public transportation, or retail stores. It's common practice in franchise locations or chain brands, too, like hotels or restaurants.<br><br> These corporations spend a lot of time and money planning a customer experience to be positive and memorable.<br><br><br>
